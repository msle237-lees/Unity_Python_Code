### üìò 1. A Survey of Imitation Learning: Algorithms, Recent Developments, and Challenges

**Overview:**
Categorizes key IL paradigms and discusses their evolution, challenges, and real-world applicability.

**Main Categories:**

* **Behavioral Cloning (BC):** Supervised learning from state-action pairs.
* **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL):** Learns reward function from expert data.
* **Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL):** Learns via discriminator-based divergence minimization.
* **Imitation from Observation (IfO):** Learns from state-only demonstrations (no actions).

**Key Challenges:**

* Covariate shift
* Suboptimal expert demonstrations
* Causal misidentification
* Distribution mismatch

**Notable Techniques:**

* **DAgger**, **HG-DAgger**, **SafeDAgger**, **ThriftyDAgger**

## üìó 2. Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL)

**Core Idea:**
Train an IL policy and use it to bootstrap exploration and training targets in off-policy RL.

#### üîë Key Equations

* **Behavioral Cloning Loss:**

  ```math
  L(\psi) = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a) \sim D} \left[ \|\mu_\psi(s) - a\|^2 \right]
  ```

* **TD Target Loss for Critic:**

  ```math
  L(\phi) = \left[ r_t + \gamma Q_{\phi'}(s_{t+1}, \pi_{\theta'}(s_{t+1})) - Q_\phi(s_t, a_t) \right]^2
  ```

* **Actor Proposal (choose better action):**

  ```math
  a^* = \arg\max_{a \in \{a_{IL}, a_{RL}\}} Q_{\phi'}(s, a)
  ```

* **Bootstrap Proposal (TD learning):**

  ```math
  Q_\phi(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow r_t + \gamma \max_{a' \in \{a_{IL}, a_{RL}\}} Q_{\phi'}(s_{t+1}, a')
  ```

**Benefits:**

* Sample-efficient
* No need for balancing RL/IL loss
* IL and RL can use different architectures

### üìô 3. Imitation Learning by Reinforcement Learning (ILR)

**Core Idea:**
Reduces IL to a single RL problem using an **intrinsic reward** of 1 for expert-like actions.

#### üîë Key Equations

* **Intrinsic Reward:**

  ```math
  R_{\text{int}}(s, a) = \mathbb{1}_{(s,a) \in D}
  ```

* **Total Variation Distance:**

  ```math
  \|\rho_E - \rho_I\|_{TV} \leq \eta
  ```

* **Reward Approximation Guarantee:**

  ```math
  \mathbb{E}_{\rho_I}[R] \geq \mathbb{E}_{\rho_E}[R] - \eta
  ```

**Guarantee:**
Under deterministic expert and ergodic MDP assumptions, imitation via RL can **match expert distribution** and reward performance.

### üìï 4. RLIF: Reinforcement Learning via Intervention Feedback

**Core Idea:**
Use **intervention signals** (instead of reward or optimal actions) as implicit feedback.

#### üîë Reward Definition

* **Intervention-Based Reward Function:**

  ```math
  \tilde{r}_\delta(s, a) = \begin{cases}
  0 & \text{if no intervention} \\
  -1 & \text{if intervention occurred}
  \end{cases}
  ```

#### üîÅ Algorithm Sketch

1. Run policy
2. If human intervenes ‚Üí assign -1 reward
3. Else ‚Üí assign 0 reward
4. Use off-policy RL to minimize interventions

#### ‚úÖ Theoretical Contributions

**Bounded Suboptimality:**

```math
\text{SubOpt} = V^*(\mu) - V^{\tilde{\pi}}(\mu)
```

Where:

* $V^*(\mu)$: Return of the optimal policy
* $V^{\tilde{\pi}}(\mu)$: Return of the learned RLIF policy

**Insight:**
The policy can improve over the suboptimal human expert by learning to avoid actions that cause interventions.
